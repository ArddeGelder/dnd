To use the effect of a runegem, you need to be wielding the weapon or shield, holding the focus in your hand, or wearing the armour it is applied to.","After a runegem has been applied, it canâ€™t be removed unless you detach it as an action or when the item it is applied to is destroyed. Not even an {@spell antimagic field} causes it to fall off.","If the item it is applied to did not originally require attunement, it does when a runegem is applied to it. (This does not make attacks with a weapon count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.) Whenever you end attunement to a weapon that has runegems applied to it, they fall off.","An item can only have one runegem applied to it, unless otherwise stated. (Typically, a +1/+2/+3 item will have 1/2/3 extra runegem slots.)","If a runegem effect causes a creature to make a saving throw, the DC of the save is determined by the same ability score as the one used to attack with that weapon.
